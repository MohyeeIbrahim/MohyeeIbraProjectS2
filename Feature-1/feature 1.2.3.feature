Feature: Store and Retrieve Customer Order History for Trend Analysis
  As a system administrator,
  I want to store and retrieve customer order history
  so that I can analyze trends and improve service offerings.

Background:
  Given system administrator is logged in

  Scenario: Storing customer order history
    Given the system is actively receiving customer orders
    When a customer 100 places an order
    Then the order details should be stored in the orders List

#  Scenario: Retrieving customer order history
#    Given customer order records exist in the order list
#    When I request order history data for a specified time period
#    Then the system should retrieve and display the list of orders from that period
#
#  Scenario: Analyzing trends from customer order history
#    Given that order history data is available for analysis
#    When I run a trend analysis report for the period 2025-03-01 to 2025-03-10
#    Then the system should provide insights such as popular meals peak order times and reorder rates
